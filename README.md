# Parallel programming in Scala

 Learned the fundamentals of parallel programming, from task parallelism to data parallelism, how to effectively parallelize familiar collections operations and build up to parallel collections.  (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne)

Main outcomes:
- reason about task and data parallel programs,
- express common algorithms in a functional style and solve them in parallel,
- competently microbenchmark parallel code,
- write programs that effectively use parallel collections to achieve performance
